export const RULES_SUMMARY = [`#### ABILITIES

- **STR**: Brawn, prowess & resistance.
- **DEX**: Dodging, sneaking & reflexes.
- **WIL**: Persuasion, intimidation & magic.

#### SAVES

**Roll a d20 equal to or under an ability. 1 is always a success, 20 is always a failure.**

#### HIT PROTECTION
HP indicates a PC’s ability to avoid getting hurt. It is lost during combat & recovered after a few moment’s rest.

#### INVENTORY
PCs have *10 inventory slots: four on their body and six in their backpack* (which acts as a sleeping bag if emptied). Most items take up a one slot, but smaller items can be bundled. Bulky items take up two slots and are awkward or difficult to carry.

Filling all ten item slots reduces a PC to 0 HP. PCs cannot carry more than their inventory allows, though carts & horses may provide an increase in slots.

#### DEPRIVATION
*Deprived PCs cannot recover HP.* If deprived for more than a day, they add a Fatigue to inventory. Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they can recover in safety. This effect is cumulative.
#### HEALING
A moment’s rest and a swig of water will restore lost HP, but may leave the party vulnerable. Ability loss requires a week’s rest and the aid of a skilled healer.

#### SPELLBOOKS 

*Spellbooks contain a single spell and take up one item slot.* Anyone can cast a spell by holding a Spellbook in both hands and reading its contents aloud. Casting a spell adds Fatigue to the PC’s inventory.

Given time and safety, PCs can enhance a spell without any additional cost. If they are deprived or in danger, a WIL save may be required to avoid terrible consequences.`,
`#### ACTIONS
On their turn, a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one action. Actions may include casting a spell, attacking, making a second move, or other reasonable activities. Actions, attacks, and movements take place simultaneously. Whenever turn order is uncertain, the PCs should make a DEX save to see if they go before their enemies.

Retreating from a dangerous situation always requires a successful DEX save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

#### DAMAGE
If an attack reduces a PC’s HP exactly to 0, refer to the Scars table.

Damage that reduces a target’s HP below 0 decreases their STR by the remainder. They must then make a STR save to avoid critical damage. Failure takes them out of combat, dying if left untreated.

Having STR 0 means death; having DEX 0 is paralysis; having WIL 0 is delirium.

#### COMBAT
The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target’s Armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent’s HP.

Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target’s Armor value from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provides a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn.

No one can have more than 3 Armor.

Unarmed attacks always do 1d4 damage. If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result. If attacking with two weapons at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the highest.

If an attack is impaired , the damage die is reduced to 1d4, regardless of weapon. If the attack is enhanced, the attacker rolls 1d12. Attacks with the blast quality affect all area targets, rolling separately for each.`
